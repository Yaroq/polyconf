Hello,

I am part of the RuPy Committee, a non profit that organizes conferences for developers.

The conference is nomadic and we make it happen in a different location each year. After Poznan in Poland, Brno in Czech Republic and Budapest in Hungary, we are planning to do the next edition in Bratislava.

The next edition will be called Polyconf and will be about using a polyglot approach in programming. We are not looking for sponsors yet, but rather for local partners that would help us make the conference a vibrant moment for the local community.

Would you be interested in helping us?

Alban
